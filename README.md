# TRU Companion

1. Usage
    
    To install and run this website, please install MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/). Then, put the whole file into your MAMP -> htdocs -> *Here!*

    Then, for the database, add it from GitHub's file in here to the following: MAMP -> db -> mysql57 -> *here*

    you should be good to run the project as of now :).

2. How it works
    Controller.php controlls most of the game, model.php has some (not all) functions :).
    Documentation still in progress as the project is still in progress.
